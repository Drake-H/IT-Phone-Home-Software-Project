## Welcome to cporterbellarmine on DockerHub!

My name is Christina Porter and with this project, I worked with Drake Hovsepian for our CS 400 Software Design and Development course.

Our project is named Valor's Schedule Planner - inspired by the mascot of Bellarmine University - and is designed to be an app that students can use to design a current-year or 4-year schedule of courses based off prerequisites, courses already taken, and the recommended course of schedules.

This was built using ReactJS with a Node.js backend. Currently, we have a working website but no content functionality. We have included the database construction of the project as referenced in the design documents.

To pull this project, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine then run `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 cporterbellarmine/it-phone-home-software-project`
