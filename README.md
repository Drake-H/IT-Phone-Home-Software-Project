## Welcome to cporterbellarmine!

My name is Christina Porter and with this project, I worked with Drake Hovsepian for our CS 400 Software Design and Development course.

Our project is named Valor's Schedule Planner - inspired by the mascot of Bellarmine University - and is designed to be an app that students can use to design a current-year or 4-year schedule of courses based off prerequisites, courses already taken, and the recommended course of schedules.

While developing this project, we had three separate parts in which we contributed to the design of the project.

1. The first phase was to create an idea of the project and create a "prototype box" that answered several questions about the project, who it was geared for, and how to market it. Our ending result of this project was a decorated box we created designed to sell a product much like any boxed software project you would see in a store. We then presented this to the class and attempted to sell our product. Our box is on display in design_documents/'product box'. Our original product idea was for an app called 'Mind Buddies' that was designed to help with mental health issues; however, our third partner and lead on that project left so we ended up changing our idea.

2. The second phase was to gather feedback upon the app by utilizing interviews for potential users and past students. We then used these stories to create feature diagrams, personas, scenarios, user stories, and a feature list. These are presented in design_documents/features_scenarios_stories_IT_Phone_Home.pdf

3. The third phase was to develop the software architecture and write a paper on the architectural components to include and the functionality each component has on the system, how the components communicate with each other, and the technologies to use in this project.

4. The final phase was to create a working prototype of the app implementing just a few features, dockerize the project, and include all the documents in our portfolio. In our project, we chose to implement the database, the react front end, and the node backend.

This was built using ReactJS with a Node.js backend. Currently, we have a working website but no content functionality. We have included the database construction of the project as referenced in the design documents.

This project taught our group much about the need to constantly adapt when working on creating a new piece of software. Our team not only needed to adapt ourselves to changing condition, requirements and abilities, but also adapt the tools and resources we used to best suit our project's purpose. On our journey from planning and design to execution, our project saw significant revisions. The biggest of these was the complete shift in direction from one product to another, when we were forced to reimagine our product due to the loss of one of our group members. 

	The resources we accessed to help design and create our prototype were not always created with the same intentions as our purpose. Our group consumed countless tutorials and guides about specific processes and the use of different tools, in order to extract a workable knowledge base that could be applied to our needs. It seemed that although people before us had used the same languages and tools for similar purposes, none of their work could be directly applied to our own issue. We needed to interpret and adapt the solutions they used for our needs.  
  
	A third lesson our group learned dearly during this project was the time investment required to design and develop software of any significance. Since we constantly needed to change and adapt as we learned more about what was both possible and required in the tools and languages we used, it always took more time at each stage and for each piece of the project than we anticipated. The never-ending learning process sometimes slowed development to a crawl when it forced us to rethink how we implement functionality that we needed, but now weren't sure how to create. Unfortunately, this became our biggest stumbling block as we weren't able to allot as much time as we would have liked towards development. The loss of our third partner represented a huge decrease in available man-hours, and our team's conflicted schedules and responsibilities took their toll on the process of researching, experimenting, and writing successful code. Nevertheless, this project represented a valuable experience in following through with a long-term development process, which we will be able to refer back to on future endeavors.
